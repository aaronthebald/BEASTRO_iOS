     What I need to do:
     1. Establish if the restaurant is open or closed.
        How? A Boolean value that is determined if right now existing within a date range.
     2. Dynamically update the text based on how close or far NOW is to next open or close date.
        If we are open, we look for closed.
            if we are closed we look for open.
